Reproducible calculations and figures for a speculative black hole cosmology model explaining cosmic asymmetries (CMB dipole, galaxy spin preference, Hubble tension) without dark matter/energy. Based on Popławski's torsion bounce and inherited Kerr spin. Verified with SymPy, tested against 2025 JWST/CMB data.
